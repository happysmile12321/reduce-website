Even more, I am thinking the way we develop applicaions, is it wrong?</p><p>The year <code>2022</code> is hard for most of application developers.A lot of company start to layoff,as I can see, there are no need so many applicaion systems for build, <code>homogenization</code> things are enough.</p><p>The Product Manager wants to put so many functions into one applicaion even through there are nobody would like to use and want to learn how to use.People don&#39;t like applicaion more and more. Enough! When application becomes so <code>scary</code> and <code>horrible</code>?</p><p>Shouldn&#39;t be like this, so I start thinking the meta relationship between application and human.If the application cannot let people get benefit,then it should not be called <code>application</code>.With this idea, I created <code>reduce</code>.</p><p>Very first principle is <code>reduce</code> is willing to thinking about users.

It is build on <code>javascript</code> and <code>rust</code>.</p></li><li><p>reduce&#39;s area is help people learning,but not do learning for people. reduce don&#39;t think it can do something for people,you can use reduce for free,do what you want. At this area, <code>reduce</code> will doing best.</p></li><li><p>After using <code>reduce</code>, you will use your brain very frequently,in other words,you will get smarter and smarter.</p></li><li><p><code>reduce</code> use simple and ingenious data structure, which means you can develop a lot of extensions for <code>reduce</code>,have fun with hack!!!</p></li></ul><p>So, in the modern world, why not give a galance of <code>reduce</code>?</p><blockquote><p>reduce is being developed very actively,is is a small and amazing application system like <code>react</code>.</p></blockquote>',11),d=[n];function c(r,s,l,p,u,h){return i(),o("div",null,d)}const _=e(a,[["render",c]]);export{g as __pageData,_ as default};
