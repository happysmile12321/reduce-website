# develop motivation

develop application always have some `distinguish` about `general` and `domain-specific`.

I am always thinking, like application `obsidian`, is it wrong start by the design goal? Even more, I am thinking the way we develop applicaions, is it wrong?

The year `2022` is hard for most of application developers.A lot of company start to layoff,as I can see, there are no need so many applicaion systems for build, `homogenization` things are enough.

The Product Manager wants to put so many functions into one applicaion even through there are nobody would like to use and want to learn how to use.People don't like applicaion more and more. Enough! When application becomes so `scary` and `horrible`?


Shouldn't be like this, so I start thinking the meta relationship between application and human.If the application cannot let people get benefit,then it should not be called `application`.With this idea, I created `reduce`.


Very first principle is `reduce` is willing to thinking about users. Every build focus on `reduce` is going to be thinking this at first.

So there are some short introduce about `reduce`:

- reduce is a domain sepecial application,so you cannot use `reduce` to resolve everything.

- reduce anti-monopoly.All the algorithm around reduce can be easy done on white paper.

- reduce is light. It is build on `javascript` and `rust`.

- reduce's area is help people learning,but not do learning for people.
reduce don't think it can do something for people,you can use reduce for free,do what you want.
At this area, `reduce` will doing best.

- After using `reduce`, you will use your brain very frequently,in other words,you will get smarter and smarter.

- `reduce` use simple and ingenious data structure, which means you can develop a lot of extensions for `reduce`,have fun with hack!!!


So, in the modern world, why not give a galance of `reduce`?


> reduce is being developed very actively,is is a small and amazing application system like `react`.
